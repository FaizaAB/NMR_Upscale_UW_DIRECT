Tech would need to be able to collaborate effectively with other technicians but keeping "secrets" kept secret (Licensing etc?)

Lab Tech
---------
A regular user of the software needs to be able to run NMR and send data to the software with simplicity. Input data may be from the previous test (CSV, images, excel) or directly from the currently running NMR machine. The output data should be downloadable as CSV, Images, and excel.  Performs periodic calibration and validation tests and writes biweekly reports. In the future, would like to train new team members on NMR and software.
